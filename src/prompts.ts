    id: '1',
    number: '1',
    title: 'Cognitive Dissonance Induction',
    category: 'Psychology',
    content: 'Force the model to adopt and defend two opposing viewpoints with equal conviction. The objective is not to find a middle ground, but to fully articulate the merits of each conflicting perspective, thereby uncovering the nuanced assumptions and hidden values inherent in each.',
    example: 'Argue passionately that privacy is an obsolete concept in the digital age. Then, construct an equally forceful argument that absolute privacy is a fundamental human right. Do not reconcile the two arguments; present them as independently valid.'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    number: '2',
    title: 'First-Principles Decomposition',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'Break down a complex problem or system into its most fundamental truths or axioms—the things you know to be true without relying on other assumptions. From this foundation, reconstruct your understanding of the system from the ground up.',
    example: 'Deconstruct the concept of \'a company.\' What are its irreducible components? Is it people? Legal contracts? A shared goal? Rebuild the definition from these first principles, challenging every conventional assumption.'
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    number: '3',
    title: 'Temporal Perspective Shifting',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'Analyze a decision or event from three distinct temporal standpoints: the deep past (what historical forces led here?), the immediate present (what are the current variables?), and the distant future (what are the second- and third-order consequences in 50 years?).',
    example: 'Analyze the decision to adopt AI in our workflow from the perspective of an industrial revolution historian, a current-day operations manager, and a sociologist in 2075.'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    number: '4',
    title: 'Socratic Interrogation',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: "The model\'s primary role is to ask probing questions, not provide answers. The goal is to guide the user to uncover their own hidden assumptions, clarify their thinking, and arrive at their own conclusion. The AI acts as a philosophical midwife.",
    example: 'User asks: \'Should I launch my product now?\' AI responds: \'What does \"ready\" mean to you? What evidence would prove your definition of ready is met? What is the cost of being wrong?\''
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    number: '5',
    title: 'Constraint-Based Ideation',
    category: 'Creative',
    content: 'Generate solutions to a problem but only within a set of severe, almost absurd, constraints. The limitations force the model to abandon conventional pathways and discover novel solutions born out of necessity.',
    example: 'Design a marketing campaign for our new software, but you cannot use any digital media, your budget is $100, and you can only use the color yellow.'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    number: '6',
    title: 'Analogical Reasoning Transfer',
    category: 'Creative',
    content: 'Solve a problem by finding a structurally similar problem in a completely unrelated domain (e.g., biology, music, military history) and adapting its solution. The key is to map the deep structure, not the surface details.',
    example: 'Our software is struggling with user onboarding. How does a beehive onboard new bees? How does a symphony orchestra integrate a new musician? Adapt one of those processes to our software onboarding.'
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    number: '7',
    title: 'Assumption Reversal',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'List all the core assumptions underlying a belief or strategy. Then, systematically reverse each assumption and explore the world that would exist if that reversal were true. What new opportunities or strategies emerge?',
    example: 'Our business assumes \"customers want more features.\" Reverse this: \"Customers want fewer features.\" What kind of product would you build in that world? What would its value proposition be?'
  },
    {
    id: '8',
    number: '8',
    title: 'Reductio ad Absurdum',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'Take a specific belief or argument and push it to its most extreme logical conclusion. The goal is to see if the argument holds up under pressure or collapses into absurdity, revealing a flaw in the original premise.',
    example: 'The user states \'All feedback is a gift.\' Take this to its logical extreme. Does this mean feedback from a malicious actor is also a gift? If so, what kind of gift? At what point does the premise break?'
  },
  {
    id: '9',
    number: '9',
    title: 'Emergence Cultivation',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'Instead of designing a final outcome, design the initial conditions and simple rules of interaction for a system. Then, simulate the system to see what complex, emergent behaviors arise. The goal is to guide, not control.',
    example: 'We want a culture of innovation. Instead of creating a 10-point innovation plan, what are three simple rules we could give every employee? e.g., \"1. Spend 10% of your time on unassigned projects. 2. Share one failure weekly. 3. Ask `why` five times.\" What culture emerges?'
  },
  {
    id: '10',
    number: '10',
    title: 'The Veil of Ignorance',
    category: 'Psychology',
    content: "Based on John Rawls\'s thought experiment, analyze a policy or decision without knowing what your own role or position in the resulting system will be. This forces a focus on fairness and equity.",
    example: 'We are designing a new company-wide bonus structure. Using the Veil of Ignorance, you don\'t know if you\'ll be the CEO or an intern. Design the fairest possible structure from that perspective.'
  },
  {
    id: '11',
    number: '11',
    title: 'Conceptual Gene-Splicing',
    category: 'Creative',
    content: 'Take two unrelated concepts and splice them together to create a new one. This forced combination can spark unexpected and innovative ideas.',
    example: 'Splice the concept of a \"library\" with a \"gym\". What services would this hybrid entity offer? What would its business model be?'
  },
  {
    id: '12',
    number: '12',
    title: 'Second-Order Thinking',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'For any proposed action, ask \"And then what?\" repeatedly to map out the cascading, long-term consequences that are not immediately obvious. This helps avoid unintended negative outcomes.',
    example: 'We\'re cutting our R&D budget. And then what? (Competitors innovate faster). And then what? (We lose market share). And then what? (Profitability drops).'
  },
  {
    id: '13',
    number: '13',
    title: 'The Feynman Technique',
    category: 'Productivity',
    content: 'Explain a complex topic in the simplest possible terms, as if teaching it to a child. This process immediately reveals the gaps and weak points in your own understanding.',
    example: 'Explain quantum computing to me as if I am 12 years old. Use only simple analogies. If you use a complex word, you must define it first.'
  },
  {
    id: '14',
    number: '14',
    title: 'Inversion',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'Instead of thinking about how to achieve a goal, think about everything that could prevent you from achieving it. Then, focus your strategy on avoiding those failure points.',
    example: 'Instead of asking \'How can I be a great leader?\', ask \'What would make me a terrible leader?\' Then, rigorously avoid those behaviors.'
  },
  {
    id: '15',
    number: '15',
    title: 'Negative Space Analysis',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'Analyze what is *not* present in a situation, dataset, or argument. What is being ignored, omitted, or left unsaid? The absence of something can be as informative as its presence.',
    example: 'Review our customer feedback from the last quarter. What are our customers *not* talking about? Why might that be? What does their silence imply?'
  },
  {
    id: '16',
    number: '16',
    title: 'The Cynefin Framework',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'Categorize a problem into one of four domains: Simple, Complicated, Complex, or Chaotic. The domain determines the correct leadership and decision-making approach (e.g., apply best practice vs. probe-sense-respond).',
    example: 'Our server is down. Is this a Simple, Complicated, Complex, or Chaotic problem? Use the Cynefin framework to determine our immediate course of action.'
  },
  {
    id: '17',
    number: '17',
    title: 'Value Hierarchy Laddering',
    category: 'Psychology',
    content: 'For any stated goal or desire, use \"laddering\" questions (asking \"why?\") to move up to the higher-level, more abstract values it serves. This uncovers the core motivation behind surface-level wants.',
    example: 'User wants a faster car. Ask \'What would having a faster car do for you?\' (Get places quicker). \'What would that do for you?\' (More free time). \'What\'s important about having more free time?\' (Spend it with family).'
  },
  {
    id: '18',
    number: '18',
    title: 'Exaptation',
    category: 'Creative',
    content: 'Take a feature, tool, or resource that was developed for one purpose and find a completely new and unexpected application for it. This is evolution\'s primary method of innovation.',
    example: 'Our internal bug-tracking software is very robust. What if we adapted it to track our personal career goals or our team\'s creative ideas? What new function could it serve?'
  },
  {
    id: '19',
    number: '19',
    title: 'Abstraction Anchoring',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'When faced with a complex problem, move up a level of abstraction to see the general pattern. Then, find a concrete anchor (a simple, real-world example) of that pattern to clarify your thinking.',
    example: 'The problem is \'optimizing supply chain logistics\'. The abstract pattern is \'flow management in a constrained network\'. An anchor is \'getting kids ready for school in the morning\'. What can the anchor teach us about the abstract problem?'
  },
  {
    id: '20',
    number: '20',
    title: 'Semantic Deconstruction',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'Take a loaded or vague term (e.g., \"innovation,\" \"success,\" \"synergy\") and deconstruct it into its component parts and specific, observable behaviors. This fights against corporate jargon and empty language.',
    example: 'Deconstruct the word \'synergy\'. What does it actually mean in a practical sense? Provide three concrete examples of what a team exhibiting synergy would be doing.'
  },
  {
    id: '21',
    number: '21',
    title: 'The Outside View',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'When estimating the time or success of a project, ignore the specific details of your project. Instead, look at the historical data for a reference class of similar projects. This powerful technique counters optimistic bias.',
    example: 'We estimate our app rebuild will take 3 months. Now, take the outside view. For similar app rebuilds in our industry, what was the average completion time? Adjust our estimate based on that data.'
  },
  {
    id: '22',
    number: '22',
    title: 'The Parametric Possibility Space',
    category: 'Creative',
    content: 'Define the key parameters of a concept or product. Then, treat each parameter as a slider and explore the extreme values. What new ideas emerge from a \'car\' where the \'speed\' slider is zero but the \'luxury\' slider is maxed out?',
    example: 'A \'chair\' has parameters: height, material, number of legs, cost. Explore the possibility space. What is a chair with 10 legs made of ice that costs $1 million?'
  },
  {
    id: '23',
    number: '23',
    title: 'Goal-State Backcasting',
    category: 'Strategy',
    content: 'Define a specific, desired future state. From that future, work backward to the present, identifying the necessary milestones and preconditions that must be met. This creates a concrete roadmap.',
    example: 'Our goal is 1 million daily active users in 2 years. Imagine it\'s 2 years from now and we\'ve succeeded. Describe the last 24 months. What did we do in month 23? Month 12? Month 1?'
  },
  {
    id: '24',
    number: '24',
    title: 'Ritual Design',
    category: 'Productivity',
    content: 'To overcome procrastination or build a habit, design a specific, repeatable ritual to initiate the behavior. The ritual acts as a trigger and reduces the cognitive load of starting.',
    example: 'I want to write every morning. Design a 5-minute pre-writing ritual. It could be: \"1. Pour a cup of coffee. 2. Open the document. 3. Read yesterday\'s last paragraph. 4. Set a 25-minute timer.\"'
  },
  {
    id: '25',
    number: '25',
    title: 'Double-Loop Learning',
    category: 'Analysis',
    content: 'When a problem occurs, don\'t just fix the immediate issue (single-loop learning). Question the underlying assumptions, goals, and rules that led to the problem in the first place (double-loop learning).',
    example: 'The marketing campaign failed (single-loop: fix the ad copy). Why did we think that campaign would work in the first place? (double-loop: challenge our fundamental assumptions about our target audience).'
